    <h2>🔗 Integrate Subservices</h2>
1.cClone Each Microservice


    git clone https://github.com/Aditi08302/Quest-For-Campus-Embers
    git clone https://github.com/mikele5895/bitcamp-dino-laws-microservice
    git clone https://github.com/sumi0309/bitcamp-ancient-scroll-microservice
2. Run Subservices (Follow Their Individual README Setup)
Each service will expose a REST API endpoint (usually something like http://localhost:8000/endpoint)

3. Update index2.html with Live Service Links
Replace placeholder or mock links in your index2.html with the actual endpoints. For example:
<pre><code>&lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/quest"&gt;Quest for Campus Embers&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://localhost:8001/dino-laws"&gt;DinoLaws&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://localhost:8002/ancient-scrolls"&gt;Ancient Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
